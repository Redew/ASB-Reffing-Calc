# ASB Reffing Calculator

I'm horrible at math. However, I love Smogon's ASB program. Unfortunately for me, reffing requires a LOT of math, which I am bad at. So, I set out to work on a reffing calculator to make reffing loads easier on me and other referees. I couldn't have done this without the help of sirDonovan, akela, and many others.

Everything in the calculator should work, but if not, contact me [here](http://www.smogon.com/forums/members/redew.79332/). You can also catch me on [#capasb](http://mibbit.com/#capasb@irc.synirc.net).
